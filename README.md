HW1 
============

Linear regression to predict PM2.5
-----------------------------------
* Use previous nine days data with their wieights to predict the tenth day's PM2.5 value
* Select suitable parameters such as learning rate, loss function, weight lamda

HW2
============

Logistic regression to classify spam emails
-------------------------------------------
* Use more data prepossing method to get better accuracy, including normalization, perceptrons learning algorithm (PLA)


HW3
============

Image classification
---------------------
* Use Convolution, Maxpooling to do the supervised learning
* Use K neighbor, and autoencoder and autodecoder to do the unsupervised learning

HW4
